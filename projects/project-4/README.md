DS | Unit Project 4

### PROMPT

In this project, you will summarize and present your analysis from Projects 1-3. Your goal is to complete your ongoing iPython Notebook, combining prior deliverables from projects 1-3 with an appendix and executive summary. This will be a final overview of your analysis that incorporates past feedback and demonstrates your approach.

**Goal:** Write up an executive summary that outlines your findings and the methods used in projects 1-3.

### DELIVERABLES

#### iPython Notebook with Executive Summary

- **Requirements:**
    -  “Specific aim”
    -  Outlined methods and models
    -  Articulation of datasets
    -  Risks and assumptions
    -  Goals and criteria for success
    -  A exploratory data analysis overview with visualizations and statistical analysis
    -  A writeup on the interpretation of findings including an executive summary with conclusions and next steps

- **Bonus:**
    - Always consider your audience - what do they already know vs. what should you define or explain?
    - Visualize your findings! Use charts, graphs, or other images as appropriate.

- **Submission:**
    - Upload to student repository.

### EVALUATION

Your project will be assessed using the following standards:

1. Present Results
2. Professional Development

#### Rubric: [Click here for the complete rubric](./project4-rubric.md).

Requirements for these standards will be assessed using the scale below:

    Score | Expectations
    ----- | ------------
    **0** | _Incomplete._
    **1** | _Does not meet expectations._
    **2** | _Meets expectations, good job!_
    **3** | _Exceeds expectations, you wonderful creature, you!_

While your total score may serve as a helpful gauge of whether you've met project goals, __specific standards scores are more important__ since they can show you where to focus your efforts in the future!

### RESOURCES

#### Dataset  
We'll be using the same dataset as UCLA's Logistic Regression in R tutorial to explore logistic regression in Python, as explained in [yhat's blog](http://blog.yhat.com/posts/logistic-regression-and-python.html). This is an excellent resource for using logistic regression and summary statistics to explore a relevant dataset. Our goal will be to identify the various factors that may influence admission into graduate school. It contains four variables- admit, gre, gpa, rank.

- 'admit' is a binary variable. It indicates whether or not a candidate was admitted admit =1) our not (admit= 0)
- 'gre' is GRE score
- 'gpa' stands for Grade Point Average
- 'rank' is the rank of an applicant's undergraduate alma mater, with 1 being the highest and 4 as the lowest

Dataset: [Admissions.csv](./assets/admissions.csv)

#### Starter code
Open the [iPython Notebook](./starter-code/project4-starter.ipynb) and follow the questions provided.

#### Suggestions for Getting Started

- Review your previous work and any prior instructor feedback.
- Look up sample executive summaries online.
